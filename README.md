Chrome Extension to show which movies on MovieLens (https://movielens.org/) are available on Netflix.

To install it, simply download the build/app.crx file and open it with Google Chrome.

Kudos to the GroupLens Research for building and amazing recommender system and Andrew Sampson for exposing such a simple Netflix API.
